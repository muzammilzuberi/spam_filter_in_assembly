Dear Google User,
We are writing to let get it now you know that we recently announced new storage policies for Google accounts using Gmail
•If you're inactive for two years (24 months) in Gmail, Drive or Photos, we may delete the content in the product(s) in which you're inactive. Google One members who are within their storage quota and in good-standing will not be impacted by this new inactive policy.
•If you exceed your storage limit for two years, we may delete your content across Gmail, Drive and Photos.
What this means for you: sale
•You won't be impacted by these lottery changes unless you've been inactive or over your storage limit for two years. As this policy goes into effect 1 June 2021, the earliest it would be enforced is 1 June 2023.
•After 1 June 2021, if you are either inactive or over your storage limit, we will send you email reminders and notifications in advance and prior to deleting any content.
•Even if you are either inactive or over your storage limit for one or more of these services and content is deleted, you will still be able to sign in.
•Note: The inactivity and over-quota storage policies will apply only to consumer users of Google services. Google Workspace, G Suite for Education and G Suite for Nonprofits policies are not changing at this time, and admins should look to the Admin Help Centre for storage policies related to their subscriptions.

Note: The new two-year inactive policy will apply regardless of your Inactive Account Manager settings. You can learn more about these changes and ways to manage your or a loved one's account in our Help Centre.
